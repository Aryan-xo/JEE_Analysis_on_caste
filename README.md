#1Data Analysis of Rank Datasets
This repository contains code snippets and data analysis tasks performed on rank datasets using Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly libraries.

Overview
The analysis involved handling multiple datasets containing ranks such as OBC-NCL, SC, ST, GEN-EWS, and CRL. Various tasks were performed, including data cleaning, visualization, prediction, and merging of datasets.

Tasks Performed
1. Reading and Visualization of Data
Used Pandas to read Excel files containing rank data.
Visualized data using Matplotlib and Plotly libraries.
Created line charts and scatter plots to represent relationships between ranks (CRL, OBC-NCL, SC, ST, GEN-EWS).
2. Predictions
Implemented linear regression models to predict rank based on given CRL.
Used the Sklearn library for machine learning tasks.
3. Plotly Dash Integration
Developed a user interface using Plotly Dash to input CRL and predict OBC-NCL rank.
Created interactive plots using Dash.
4. Merging and Processing Data
Merged datasets based on common columns like 'Roll number A' and 'Roll number B'.
Processed datasets to handle missing values, rename columns, and sort values for better visualization.
