# Data Analysis of Rank Datasets

This repository contains code snippets and data analysis tasks performed on rank datasets using Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly libraries.

## Overview

The analysis involved handling multiple datasets containing ranks such as OBC-NCL, SC, ST, GEN-EWS, and CRL. Various tasks were performed, including data cleaning, visualization, prediction, and merging of datasets.

## Tasks Performed

### 1. Reading and Visualization of Data

- Used Pandas to read Excel files containing rank data.
- Visualized data using Matplotlib and Plotly libraries.
- Created line charts and scatter plots to represent relationships between ranks (CRL, OBC-NCL, SC, ST, GEN-EWS).

### 2. Predictions

- Predict rank based on given CRL.

### 3. Plotly Dash Integration

- Developed a user interface using Plotly Dash to input CRL and predict OBC-NCL rank.
- Created interactive plots using Dash.

### 4. Merging and Processing Data

- Merged datasets based on common columns like 'Roll number A' and 'Roll number B'.
- Processed datasets to handle missing values, rename columns, and sort values for better visualization.
